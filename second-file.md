# Git and GitHub

Git and GitHub are not the same thing. In fact, Git isn't even a GitHub product. It's an open-source tool maintained by a community of developers:

GitHub is a website, whereas Git is a piece of desktop software. Git provides functionality for tracking and merging changes to files in a project, a process called "version control". GitHub provides a central location for hosting, sharing, and managing these projects, as well as a web interface for some Git functionality. GitHub also offers additional, complementary features and products to facilitate other elements of software development, beyond version control.
